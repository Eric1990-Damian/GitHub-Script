# Windows Terminal Theme Changes

OK, so a while ago one of my friend's coworkers had a silly looking theme on his command prompt window. I thought it was interesting and decided to do a little research with that same friend and stumbled upon it. 

In this segment, I will show you the hard way to get this done and the much simpler way to acheive this. 

Slightly more difficult path:

Step 1:
You will need a windows based device (did not work on my MAC)

Step 2: 
Google "windows terminal" and download this application. It is free of charge

Step 3:
Ensure you have some type of Code Editor 

Step 4:
Once you have everything downloaded, you can search the internet for different Gifs, pictures or themes. Save them onto a folder within your computer 

Step 5: 
open up Windows terminal and at the top of the window you will see a drop down arrow, Click the arrow and go to settings

Step 6: 
Open "JSON File" this will open with your Code Editor

Step 7: 
Locate the following ("Background Image": "insert file path to your themes")

Step 8:
Enjoy the new theme

Have fun!!!
